# Planetary-Image-Processor
A set of python tools for processing ground-based images of planets and stars. This involves the summation of many images taken through different filters, the subtraction of sky noise, and the addition of RGB coloring to the final image.

The strange indexing found on some of Jupiter's images are due to the need to mask bright pixels which skew the actual center of the image. This is needed to properly align the multiple images for combining them into the final photo.
